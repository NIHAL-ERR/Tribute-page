                <img src="https://starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Jaggi-Vasudev-in-Young-Age.jpg" width=20%
                    alt="early image of sadhguru">
                <p>Jaggi Vasudev was born on 3 September 1957 in Mysore, Karnataka, India to a Telugu speaking
                    family. He had four siblings – two brothers and two sisters and was the youngest of them all.
                    His mother was a house maker and his father worked at the Indian Railways as an ophthalmologist. The
                    family frequently moved due to the nature of his father's job. He lived in Shimoga, Chikkaballapur,
                    and Guntakal for a brief time and returned to Mysore with his family in 1969.

                    Vasudev showed an inclination towards nature during his early life. He spent time trekking alone in
                    forests as a child and developed an interest in snakes, often keeping them as pets.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>

                    alt="mysore university" width="40%">
                <p>After his schooling at Demonstration School, Mysore and Mahajana Pre-University College, Vasudev
                    graduated from the University of Mysore with a bachelor's degree in English, despite a spotty
                    attendance record and an irreverent attitude to tuition. Defying his parents’ wishes, he refused
                    to pursue a post-graduate course and took to business instead.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Spirituality</h2>
                <img src="https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2019/story/images/big/is-spirituality-an-art-or-science--2019-07-15.jpg"
                    alt="spirituality image" width=30%>
                <p>Aged thirteen, Vasudev took yoga lessons from Malladihalli Raghavendra, and kept practicing asanas
                    and pranayama daily throughout his youth, albeit without spiritual aspirations.At the age
                    of 25, on 23 September 1982, he went up Chamundi Hill and sat on a rock, where he had a 'spiritual
                    experience'. Six weeks afterwards, he left his business to his friend and travelled extensively
                    in an effort to gain insight into his mystical experience.After about a year of meditation and
                    travel, he decided to teach yoga to share his inner experience.

                    In 1983, he taught his first yoga class with seven participants in Mysore. Over time, he began
                    conducting yoga classes across Karnataka and Hyderabad travelling on his motorcycle, subsisting on
                    the produce of his poultry farm rental and donating the collections received from his students to a
                    local charity on the last day of the class.</p>

                <img src="https://images.sadhguru.org/sites/default/files/media_files/jviji17.jpg" alt="sadhguru wife "
                    width=40%>
                <p>Vasudev's family’s lineage is linked on his mother’s side, to Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara
                    Empire.His paternal great-grandmother, Kuntamma, impacted him as a child. Called Kuntamma or
                    one who limps, she built a temple, but was considered unorthodox by society’s standards, because of
                    her loud laugh and lack of respect for social conventions, especially in worship and religion.
                    Vasudev has fondly recalled how her bedtime stories kept him engaged, and how her exuberant style of
                    worship intrigued him.Kuntamma’s son and Vasudev’s grandfather was a wealthy man with a large
                    ancestral home. It was at his grandfather’s house that Vasudev first came in touch with Malladihalli
                    Raghavendra, from whom he learnt yoga.

                    He met Vijayakumari, known as Vijji, in 1984 after a yoga class in Mysuru. Vijayakumari had
                    previously been through a difficult marriage and divorce.After a brief romance, they made an
                    impromptu decision to get married during a trip to Irupu Falls on Maha Shivaratri. Vijayakumari and
                    Vasudev’s mother developed a close relationship, while Vijayakumari’s parents respected Vasudev
                    because her father benefited from Vasudev’s yoga classes after suffering a paralytic stroke.

                    Vasudev’s mother passed away in 1989 of renal failure.In 1990, Vasudev and Vijayakumari had a
                    daughter, Radhe.On 22 January 1997, Vijayakumari passed away at a large gathering at the Isha
                    Yoga Center. After a complaint alleging foul play was filed eight months later, an inquiry was
                    conducted.</p>
